# C++ Design Patterns

This repository serves as a reference for various design patterns implemented in C++. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise in software design. Understanding and applying these patterns can lead to more maintainable and scalable code.

## Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design. They provide a template for solving specific issues and can speed up the development process by promoting best practices.

This repository covers a variety of design patterns implemented in C++. Each design pattern is accompanied by sample code and explanations to help you understand when and how to use them.

## List of Design Patterns

1. [Singleton Pattern](/Singleton)
   - Description and use cases
   - Sample implementation in C++

2. [Observer Pattern](/Observer)
   - Description and use cases
   - Sample implementation in C++

3. [Factory Method Pattern](/FactoryMethod)
   - Description and use cases
   - Sample implementation in C++

4. [Builder Pattern](/Builder)
   - Description and use cases
   - Sample implementation in C++

<!-- Add more design patterns as needed -->

## How to Use This Repository

Each design pattern is organized in its own directory within the repository. Inside each directory, you'll find:

- **README.md:** Detailed information about the design pattern, its use cases, and how to implement it.
- **src:** Sample C++ code implementing the design pattern.
- **tests:** Unit tests (if applicable) to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

Feel free to explore the patterns based on your needs or use them as a reference when designing your own systems.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have additional design patterns to share, improvements to existing ones, or better explanations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
